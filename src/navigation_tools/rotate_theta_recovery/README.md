# Rotate Theta Recovery

ROS plugin for recovery behavior involving rotation.

## Description

This package implements the abstract recovery behavior from the ROS navigation stack for rotation. It is a modified version of the [rotate_recovery](http://wiki.ros.org/rotate_recovery?distro=melodic) package. The goal of this package is to enable a robot to recover from a localization failure by rotating in place safely in order to take a better view of the environment and hopefully regain localization. It can also aid in regaining localization by clearing noise from the robot's local map. 

## Dependencies

Requires ROS navigation

## Instructions

Instructions for using ROS navigation plugins can be found [here](http://wiki.ros.org/rotate_recovery?distro=melodic)
