# Clear Area Recovery

ROS plugin for recovery behavior involving local cost maps.

## Description

This package implements the abstract recovery behavior from the ROS navigation stack for clearing costmaps. It is a modified version of the [clear_costmap_recovery](http://wiki.ros.org/clear_costmap_recovery?distro=melodic) package. The goal of this package is to enable a robot to recover from a localization failure by clearing the local costmap so that any noise that was interpreted as an obstacle can be reset. 

## Dependencies

Requires ROS navigation

## Instructions

Instructions for using ROS navigation plugins can be found [here](http://wiki.ros.org/clear_costmap_recovery?distro=melodic)
